    <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            The Hush Sound is an American indie pop band from Chicago, Illinois, United States. Initially named "The Hush," the band later changed its name to "The Hush Sound" due to the discovery of a rapper with the same name.
        </p>

            The band consists of Bob Morris (vocals and guitar), Chris Faller (bass guitar) and vocals), Darren Wilson (drums, percussion and vocals), and Greta Salpeter (vocals and piano). Mike Leblanc (bass guitar) temporarily replaced Faller for a few months in 2008.
